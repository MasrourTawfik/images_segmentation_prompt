Training on a simple dataset
-----------------------------

1. **DataPreprocessing<https://github.com/imadmlf/Neural_Network_Wrapper/blob/main/DataPreprocessing.py>__**: 

This module likely contains functions or classes for preparing your raw data for analysis. This can include tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **DataExploration<https://github.com/imadmlf/Neural_Network_Wrapper/blob/main/DataExploration.py>__**:

 This part of your pipeline focuses on understanding the structure and characteristics of your dataset. It might include functions or classes for displaying basic statistics (like mean, median, standard deviation), visualizations (like histograms, scatter plots, or correlation matrices), and checking for any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data.

3. **ModelTraining<https://github.com/imadmlf/Neural_Network_Wrapper/blob/main/modeltrainer.py>__**: 

Here, you're training a machine learning model on your preprocessed data. This typically involves selecting an appropriate algorithm (like a neural network), defining a loss function, and optimizing model parameters using an optimization algorithm (like stochastic gradient descent).

4. **ModelEvaluation<https://github.com/imadmlf/Neural_Network_Wrapper/blob/main/ModelEvaluation.py>__**:

 After training your model, you need to evaluate its performance. This module likely contains functions or classes for computing various evaluation metrics (like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score), generating confusion matrices, and visualizing prediction results.

5. **NeuralNetwork<https://github.com/imadmlf/Neural_Network_Wrapper/blob/main/neural_network.py>__**:

 This appears to be a class for defining a neural network architecture using the PyTorch library. It specifies the layers, activation functions, and connections between neurons in the network.
