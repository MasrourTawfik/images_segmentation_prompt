======================
5. Detection Transformer
-------------------------

DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model trained end-to-end on COCO 2017 object detection (118k annotated images). It was introduced in the paper `End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers <https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872>`__
 by Carion et al.
