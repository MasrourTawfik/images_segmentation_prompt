    Vision Transformers are type of deep learning model and they are designed for computer vision tasks, they are inspired by the success of Transformer models in natural language processing. Traditionally computer used a technique called convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks but now the vision Transformers are newer approach that gained a lot of attention.
