         A transformer decoder is a neural network architecture used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text generation. It combines with an encoder to process input text and generate output text. It has multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. It is trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. It is known for its accuracy and natural-sounding output.
