    <span style="color:#00008B;">  

    The paper addresses the challenge of applying Transformer architecture to Computer Vision tasks, aiming to reduce the heavy reliance on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the field. It argues that this transition would yield comparable results to traditional CNNs while requiring fewer computational resources for training.

    What is the relevant background for this problem?
    </span>
    <span style="color:#00008B;">

    Transformers have been extensively used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, exemplified by state-of-the-art models like BERT and GPT. While there has been some exploration of using transformers for image tasks, it has generally been resource-intensive.
