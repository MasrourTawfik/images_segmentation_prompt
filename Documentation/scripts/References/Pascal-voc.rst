    The PASCAL (Pattern Analysis, Statistical Modeling, and Computational Learning) network, funded by the European Union, plays a pivotal role in advancing research in computer vision and machine learning. One of its notable contributions is the establishment of the Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. Running annually from 2005 to 2012, the VOC Challenge has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of object detection technologies. Participants were provided with a series of images and corresponding annotations, with the challenge to develop models capable of accurately identifying objects within these images.

    In response to the inaugural 2005 challenge, the PASCAL VOC XML format was introduced, quickly becoming a standard labeling format within the field. Unlike the COCO JSON format, which uses a single annotation file for all images within a dataset, the VOC format assigns an individual XML file to each image. This approach offers a fine-grained and image-specific annotation process, facilitating detailed object detection and recognition tasks.

    The XML format is structured hierarchically, resembling a tree, and encapsulates all essential information within an 'annotation' tag. Key fields include:
